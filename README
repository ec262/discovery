The discovery server for ec262, version 0.

This app is written in Sinatra, backed by Redis, hosted on Heroku, and should
basically explain itself. Here's a tour of the dead simple API:

POST /register
  - Register a worker to the worker pool by IP address. Should return status
    code 200 if all goes well.

GET /workers
  - Returns the list of IP addresses of available workers in JSON.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
TODO

  - Before sending back the list of workers, the server should quickly ping
    the workers (or at least the ones it hasn't pinged recently) and make sure
    they're still alive and accepting jobs.
    
  - It might also be nice to see if workers want to accept a job from the
    requester
    
  - Authentication, API keys, etc...
